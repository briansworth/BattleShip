The battleship.cs file can be used to create an executable file in Windows to launch and begin playing.  The game has a menu with multiple difficulties to choose from (even some hidden options).  No computer AI, just you and a limited amount of rockets to shoot at a randomly generated Battleship layout.  All 5 ship types are included: Carrier, Battleship, Destroyer, Submarine, and Patrol Boat.  Upon victory/loss the ship layout will be revealed.
